function i4_huge ( )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! I4_HUGE returns a "huge" I4.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    On an IEEE 32 bit machine, I4_HUGE should be 2^31 - 1, and its
!    bit pattern should be
!
!     01111111111111111111111111111111
!
!    In this case, its numerical value is 2147483647.
!
!    Using the Dec/Compaq/HP Alpha FORTRAN compiler FORT, I could
!    use I4_HUGE() and HUGE interchangeably.
!
!    However, when using the G95, the values returned by HUGE were
!    not equal to 2147483647, apparently, and were causing severe
!    and obscure errors in my random number generator, which needs to
!    add I4_HUGE to the seed whenever the seed is negative.  So I
!    am backing away from invoking HUGE, whereas I4_HUGE is under
!    my control.
!
!    Explanation: because under G95 the default integer type is 64 bits!
!    So HUGE ( 1 ) = a very very huge integer indeed, whereas
!    I4_HUGE ( ) = the same old 32 bit big value.
!
!    An I4 is an integer ( kind = 4 ) value.
