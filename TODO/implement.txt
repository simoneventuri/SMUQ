 - implement nataf transform so that the space sampler is able to sample correlated spaces other than multivariate normal
 - change file readrecord to use non-predetermined length buffer
 - figure out a way to do lars without scaling and centering
 - make array import/export routines for real(4), real(8), etc instead of rkp
 - add the ability to specify a column for vector import and array export
 - remove the bash script for code inititation ( its only used to have multiple bayesian inference chains )
